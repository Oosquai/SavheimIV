Savheim IV - Lots of important information has been added to item tooltips.  Pay close attention to weapon tooltips, check your Hammer tooltip for new ways to build, and much more!
Savheim IV - You can reposition some GUI windows by clicking & dragging, or Left-Alt and then click & drag.  Press Esc to get a cursor.
Savheim IV - Recommended game settings I:  Disable Depth of Field, Chromatic Aberration, and Motion Blur.  You can also disable Key Hints and Raven hints if you like.
Savheim IV - Recommended game settings II:  Please try Settings/Accessibility/Camera Shake = ON.  Iron Gate swapped Mouse 2 and 3 for Secondary Attack and Block - swap them back if you prefer.
Savheim IV - The game takes a while to load with so many mods installed.  Please go get a tankard of ale and use the Viking potty.
Savheim IV - Group commands: /invite [name]; /leave; /remove [name]; /promote [name].  Group benefits:  shared exp, group gem effects, draggable user interface, group chat (/p), colored names, group ping (LeftAlt), and bonus comfort while resting together.  Try combining two boss gems.
Savheim IV - Press 'U' to open Guild panel.  This has been added to Savheim IV only to allow sharing semi-private portals.
Savheim IV - There's a new type of portal you'll eventually discover that's harder for creatures to destroy, but portals in general are now harder to obtain and will default to Private on creation.  You will not be able to teleport metals.
Savheim IV - All weapon classes have been majorly reworked in Savheim IV (again!) to give them unique and improved playstyles.  Give them all another swing, even if you decided against them last playthrough...  Wait, are you reading online info about meta builds??  This. Is. SAVHEIM!!!
Savheim IV - Block Armor = amount you can block.  [Block Armor * Parry Bonus] = amount you can parry.  Excess damage drains health.  Block Force does nothing.
Savheim IV - Backstab: sneaking, attack from behind, and enemy not in combat.  Critical: attack a staggered enemy.  Parry: perfectly-timed block.
Savheim IV - Slope combat works much better now, but you have to aim your crosshairs vertically as well as horizontally!
Savheim IV - Harpoons now have a basic secondary attack.  Primary attack tethers, and then the Use key reels the tether in if it's lighter than you.  If it's heavier than you, well, with great power comes great responsibility...  seriously, try harpooning a distant tree and then pressing E.
Savheim IV - Sneaking no longer consumes stamina, levels faster, and now gains movement speed instead of stamina benefits from leveling.  Succesful backstabs award bonus experience.
Savheim IV - Torches are more useful now!  They protect from Cold in a small radius, last longer, and can be upgraded at the workbench for greater duration.
Savheim IV - Most gear can have 3 sockets max, though you'll need to hunt rare materials for the third socket.  Jewelry cannot be socketed.
Savheim IV - Try to unlock as many recipes as you can...  Bronze Nails?  What do I need those for?  Craft them and see!
Savheim IV - Once you can craft them, it's a good idea to keep a Rune Focus and a Soulcatcher Lantern with you on adventures.  Use the Rune Focus on lore stones.  Use the lantern on souls of defeated enemies.
Savheim IV - You can modify the color of text on signs.  Open the sign prompt as usual and type < color=white> or < color=#FFFFFF> (remove the space between "< color"), then type your message.  Use multiple tags for rainbow signs!  The color automatically resets if you enter new text.
Savheim IV - Building tips!  While holding your hammer and hovering over a placed piece, hold shift and press the deconstruct button to select that piece.  Q and E cycle snap points.  Selections per tab persist, so you can change tabs and then hit Esc to quickly swap build pieces on different tabs.
Savheim IV - You've learned to dive under the water by pointing down and pressing crouch!  Swimming consumes less stamina as you level it up.  Go swimming!  Wat-er you waiting for??
Savheim IV - Boss powers now have both passive and active aspects, and you get to choose two!  Read about them at the starting stones or in your Valheim Compendium (inventory -> raven icon).  Keybinds are hardcoded to T and G, regardless of in-game settings.
Savheim IV - World progression is now tied to your character.  You must be present for boss kills to get credit for them.  This affects your ability to equip gear & boss powers, merchant inventory, world spawns, and maybe more!
Savheim IV - You must defeat all main bosses preceeding the tier of gear you wish to equip, including unique weapons.  Iron Sword?  Gotta deal with Eikthyr and The Elder before you know how to use one.
Savheim IV - Death continues to make progress in therapy, though lately there have been some mixed results.  You'll still keep your gear when you die, but all skills now lose experience on death.  Resurrect each other with Surtling Cores.
Savheim IV - Check your Valheim Compendium (inventory -> raven icon) for useful game and mod information, including Active Effects.
Savheim IV - Comfort and Rested are easier to obtain, but teleporting long distances will now reduce your Rested duration.  The radius of the map is worth about 90 minutes of Rested.  F6 toggles a list of comforting pieces while in shelter.  Rest in groups for extra duration!
Savheim IV - Waypoints offer safety from monsters, warmth, and a way to pick up a Rested buff in the field if you sit near it during favorable weather.
Savheim IV - Zone progression:  Meadows -> Black Forest -> Swamp -> Mountains -> Plains -> Mistlands -> Ashlands -> Deep North.  They all hold surprises since Savheim III!
Savheim IV - Most outdoor camps, resources, and dungeons will respawn slowly at varying rates, but only if players haven't built anything near them.
Savheim IV - Steps have been taken to ensure we can all coexist in the same world despite playing at different speeds.  Relax and enjoy the journey.
Savheim IV - Sell precious stones, trophies, extra keys, and wishbones to the traders.  Split stacks in your inventory to control quantities you want to sell.  Double-click items you want to buy to specify quantities.
Savheim IV - The world gets more dangerous the further from the center you travel.  Those who venture far return wealthy... if they return at all.
Savheim IV - Thank you to Iron Gate Studio for making Valheim such an amazing game, and to all the creative modders out there for so many incredible additions!
Savheim IV - Thank you to some very talented modders:  Azumatt, blaxxun, wackymole, Jere, KG, Blacks7ar, ASharpPen, Rusty, Searica, MSchmoecker, shudnal, Alcan, and more!
*Savheim IV - Thank you to Matt, Jake, and Woody for playtesting Savheim IV and helping resolve lots of issues before launch!  Thanks to Matt for TotinoTunes and Jake for that awesome Savheim IV video in Discord!
Savheim IV - I've intentionally left the BepInEx console enabled.  If you ever see RED error text, please drop your entire \Valheim\BepInEx\LogOutput.log file into the Discord/Savheim IV/bug-reports channel.
Savheim IV - There's now a search feature in the hammer build menu.  Advanced search options:  @<modname>, !<characteristic or resource>
Savheim IV - Gems and jewelry have been completely reworked.  Craft a Jeweler's Box at the Gemcutter's table to conveniently take jewelry options with you on adventures.
Savheim IV - Iron Gate gave Ashlands enemies juke attack animations.  They're scary.  Bring a tower shield and block them until you learn their timing.
Savheim IV - Each boss now has a small chance to drop a variety of weapons unique to that boss.  These weapons trade upgradeable stats for powerful special effects.  You'll have opportunities to find endgame versions of each.
Savheim IV - You'll now earn catch-up experience for skills working back toward all-time highs, as well as alternate weapon skills compared to your most experienced weapon skill.
Savheim IV - Most bows and crossbows now have a small chance their projectiles will leave behind reusable fletchings.  Wood arrows and bolts can now be crafted from inventory, but they do less damage.
Savheim IV - All players can now create a marketplace for other players to buy from.  Please help make the economy interesting by setting what you think are competitive prices.  Please don't spoil the game for others by setting minimum prices.
Savheim IV - Pick an ammo type to be your top of the order, put it on your hotbar, then tap that number instead of F to reset your rotation.  Ammo sequence is based on inventory location.  Utility spells only enter the rotation if on your main hotbar.  The Ammo Tote hides ammo.
Savheim IV - New keys:  L-Alt: dodge.  T, G: use boss power.  F: cycle ammo.  Z: compare item.  ~: swap hotbars.  Z, X, C: mini-hotbar.  P: toggle map portal display.  O: Guilds interface.  Left-ctrl: Change + to - for crafting resource tracker.  Read your Hammer tooltip for build-specific keys.
Savheim IV - Items needed to summon bosses now have small chances to drop from specific creatures.  Take note, for these same creatures will begin to hoarde these items after you've slain their master.
Savheim IV - Fishing no longer requires stamina.  Fish chum help attract fish.  Several new food recipes involving fish are now available, offering unique stat combinations.
Savheim IV - You're not intended to achieve high enchanting levels on early-game gear.  It's Ok to not have a +20 Flint Knife.  Your Enchanting skill will increase with time as you adventure and fight creatures.  Chill, and get back to adventuring.
Savheim IV - Level 50 blacksmiths can repair from inventory.  Level 50 builders sometimes save resources.  Level 30 farmers can see plant progress.  Level 30 foragers can see respawn times.  Level 50 miners have a chance to demolish entire rocks.  Ranchers can sense hunger at level 10, calm nearby creatures at level 25, and see pregnancy status at level 50.
Savheim IV - Most weapon types now offer some form of debuff or secondary damage.  Different creatures are susceptible to these in unique ways.  Experiment to find viable strategies for applying these new tools.
Savheim IV - The more stars a creature has, the better the loot.  At three stars and up you'll start to see increasingly precious components.  Infused creatures are rare and have coveted treasures.
Savheim IV - Meadows on the starting continent will always be a safe place.  The same cannot be said for anywhere else in the world.
