Savheim IV - Lots of important information has been added to item tooltips.  For example, look closely at your Hammer's description for new ways to build, and at boss trophies!
Savheim IV - You can reposition some GUI windows by clicking & dragging, or Left-Alt and then click & drag.  Press Esc to get a cursor.
Savheim IV - Recommended game settings I:  Disable Depth of Field, Chromatic Aberration, and Motion Blur.  You can also disable Key Hints and Raven hints if you like.  Iron Gate swapped Mouse 2 and 3 for Secondary Attack and Block - swap them back if you prefer.
Savheim IV - Recommended game settings II:  Please try turning Settings -> Accessibility -> Camera Shake back on!  I've carefully tuned it.
Savheim IV - The game takes a while to load with so many mods installed.  Go get a tankard of ale and use the Viking potty.
Savheim IV - Group commands: /invite [name]; /leave; /remove [name]; /promote [name].  Group benefits:  shared exp, group gem effects, draggable user interface, group chat (/p), colored names, and group ping (LeftAlt).
Savheim IV - Swap hotbars - ~ (above Tab).  Dodge - Tap Alt or hold block and press jump.  Parry - block just in time.  Secondary attack - middle mouse button.  
Savheim IV - All weapon classes have been reworked in Savheim IV to give them unique and improved playstyles.  Give them all a second swing, even if you decided against them last playthrough...  Wait, are you reading online info about meta builds??  This. Is. SAVHEIM!!!
Savheim IV - Block Armor = how much you can block.  [Block Armor * Parry Bonus] = how much you can parry.  Excess damage drains health.  Tower shields drain stamina before health.  Block Force does nothing.
Savheim IV - Backstab: sneaking, attack from behind, and enemy not in combat.  Critical:  Attack a staggered enemy.
Savheim IV - Slope combat works much better now, but you have to aim your crosshairs vertically as well as horizontally!
Savheim IV - Harpoons now have a basic secondary attack.  Primary attack tethers, and then the Use key reels the tether in if it's lighter than you.  If it's heavier than you, well, with great power comes great responsibility.
Savheim IV - Sneaking no longer consumes stamina, levels faster, and now gains movement speed instead of stamina benefits from leveling.  Succesful backstabs award bonus experience.  Swimming consumes less stamina as you level it up.
Savheim IV - Torches are much more useful now!  They protect from Cold in a small radius, except in Mountains.  They last longer, and they can be upgraded at the workbench for greater duration.
Savheim IV - Most gear can have 3 sockets max, though you'll need to hunt rare materials for the third socket.  Jewelry cannot be socketed.
Savheim IV - Try to unlock as many recipes as you can...  Bronze Nails?  What do I need those for?  Craft them and see!
Savheim IV - Once you can craft them, it's a good idea to keep a Rune Focus and a Soulcatcher Lantern with you on adventures.  Use the Rune Focus on lore stones.  Use the lantern on souls of defeated enemies.
Savheim IV - You can modify the color of text on signs.  Open the sign prompt as usual and type < color=white> or < color=#FFFFFF> (remove the space between "< color"), then type your message.  Use multiple tags for rainbow signs!  The color automatically resets if you enter new text.
Savheim IV - Building tips!  While holding your hammer and hovering over a placed piece, hold shift and press the deconstruct button to select that piece.  Q and E cycle snap points.  Selections per tab persist, so you can change tabs and then hit Esc to quickly swap build pieces on different tabs.
Savheim IV - You've learned to dive under the water by pointing down and pressing crouch!  Go swimming!  Wat-er you waiting for??
Savheim IV - Boss powers now have both passive and active aspects, and you get to choose two!  Read about them at the starting stones or in your Valheim Compendium (inventory -> raven icon).  Keybinds are hardcoded to F and G, regardless of in-game settings.
Savheim IV - World progression is now tied to your character.  You must be present for boss kills to get credit for them.  This affects boss powers, merchant inventory, raids, and maybe more!
Savheim IV - Death went to therapy and is nicer now.  You'll no longer drop equipment, ammo, or consumables when you die.  Resurrect each other with Surtling Cores.
Savheim IV - Check your Valheim Compendium (inventory -> raven icon) for useful game and mod information, including Active Effects.
Savheim IV - Comfort and Rested are easier to obtain, but teleporting long distances will now reduce your Rested duration (Full map radius = ~60m).  F6 toggles a list of pieces while in shelter.  Rest in groups for extra duration!
Savheim IV - Waypoints offer safety from monsters, warmth, and a way to pick up a Rested buff in the field if you sit near it during favorable weather.
Savheim IV - Zone progression:  Meadows -> Black Forest -> Swamp -> Mountains -> Plains -> Mistlands -> Ashlands -> Deep North.  They all hold surprises since Savheim III, increasingly-so toward the end!
Savheim IV - Outdoor camps, resources, and dungeons will all respawn slowly at varying rates.
Savheim IV - Steps have been taken to ensure we can all coexist in the same world despite playing at different speeds.  Relax and enjoy the journey.
Savheim IV - Sell precious stones & trophies to the traders.  Split stacks in your inventory to control quantities you want to sell.  Double-click items you want to buy to specify quantities.
Savheim IV - The world gets more dangerous the further from the center you travel.  Those who venture far return wealthy... if they return at all.
Savheim IV - Thank you to Iron Gate Studio for making Valheim such an amazing game, and to all the creative modders out there for so many incredible additions!
Savheim IV - Thank you to some very talented modders:  Azumatt, blaxxun, wackymole, KG, Blacks7ar, ASharpPen, Rusty, Searica, MSchmoecker, shudnal, Alcan, and more!
Savheim IV - Thank you to Matt, Jake, and Woody for playtesting Savheim IV and helping resolve lots of issues before launch!  Thanks to Matt for TotinoTunes and Jake for that awesome Savheim IV video in Discord!
Savheim IV - I've intentionally left the BepInEx console enabled.  If you ever see RED error text, please drop your entire \Valheim\BepInEx\LogOutput.log file into the Discord/Savheim IV/bug-reports channel.
Savheim IV - There's now a search feature in the hammer build menu.  Advanced search options:  @<modname>, !<characteristic or resource>
Savheim IV - Press Z while hovering over an item to compare to what you currently have equipped.
Savheim IV - Gems and jewelry have been completely reworked.
Savheim IV - Iron Gate gave Ashlands enemies juke attack animations.  Block them to learn their timing before trying to parry them!
Savheim IV - All build pieces can now be reinforced with resin and tar to prevent weather damage.  Put it on your hotbar and press the corresponding button while moused over.  Resin fades.  Tar is permanent.  You don't need both.
Savheim IV - All bosses have a small chance to drop a variety of unique weapons.  These can't be upgraded, and thus suffer lower damage than others in their tier, but they offer powerful special effects.  You'll have opportunities to find endgame versions of each.
Savheim IV - You'll now earn catch-up experience for skills working back toward all-time highs, as well as alternate weapon skills compared to your most experienced weapon skill.
Savheim IV - All bows and crossbows now have a small chance their projectiles will leave behind reusable fletchings.  Wood arrows and bolts can now be crafted from inventory, but they do less damage.
Savheim IV - All players can now create a marketplace for other players to buy from.  Please help make the economy interesting by setting what you think are fair prices.
