Savheim IV - Lots of important information has been added to item tooltips.  For example, look closely at your Hammer's description for new ways to build, and at boss trophies!
Savheim IV - You can reposition some GUI windows by clicking & dragging, or Left-Alt and then click & drag.  Press Esc to get a cursor.
Savheim IV - Recommended game settings:  Disable Camera Shake, Depth of Field, Chromatic Aberration, and Motion Blur.  You can also disable Key Hints and Raven hints if you like.  Iron Gate swapped Mouse 2 and 3 for Secondary Attack and Block - swap them back if you prefer.
Savheim IV - The game takes a while to load with so many mods installed.  Go get a tankard of ale and use the Viking potty.  Patience is a viking virtue.
Savheim IV - Group commands: /invite [name]; /leave; /remove [name]; /promote [name].  Group benefits:  shared exp, group gem effects, draggable user interface, group chat (/p), colored names, and group ping (LeftAlt).
Savheim IV - Press ~ (above Tab) to swap hotbars.  Dodge - press Alt or hold block and press jump.  Parry - block just in time.  Secondary attack - middle mouse button.  
Savheim IV - All weapon classes have been reworked in Savheim IV to give them unique and improved playstyles.  Give them all a second swing, even if you decided against them last playthrough.  ... wait, are you reading online info about meta builds??  This. Is. SAVHEIM!!!
Savheim IV - Block Armor = how much you can block.  [Block Armor * Parry Bonus] = how much you can parry.  Excess damage drains health.  Tower shields drain stamina before health.  Block Force does nothing.
Savheim IV - Backstab: sneaking, attack from behind, and enemy not in combat.  Critical:  Attack a staggered enemy.
Savheim IV - Slope combat works much better now, but you have to aim your crosshairs vertically as well as horizontally!
Savheim IV - Harpoons now have a basic secondary attack.  Primary attack tethers, and then the Use key reels the tether in if it's lighter than you.  If it's heavier than you, well, with great power comes great responsibility.
Savheim IV - Stealth no longer consumes stamina, moves faster, and levels faster.  Swimming consumes less stamina as you level it up.  Food and rested buffs help even more with stamina.  Being Cold hurts stamina.
Savheim IV - Torches are much more useful now!  They protect from Cold in a small radius, except in Mountains.  They last longer, and they can be upgraded at the workbench for greater duration and damage.
Savheim IV - Most gear can have 3 sockets max.  Increase the level of your Gemcutters table to add additional sockets.  Jewelry cannot be socketed.
Savheim IV - Try to unlock as many recipes as you can...  Bronze Nails?  What do I need those for?  Craft them and see!
Savheim IV - Once you can craft them, it's a good idea to keep a Rune Focus and a Soulcatcher Lantern with you on adventures.  Use the Rune Focus on lore stones.  Use the lantern on souls of defeated enemies.
Savheim IV - You can modify the color of text on signs.  Open the sign prompt as usual and type < color=white> or < color=#FFFFFF> (remove the space between "< color"), then type your message.  Use multiple tags for rainbow signs!  The color automatically resets if you enter new text.
Savheim IV - Building tips!  While holding your hammer and hovering over a placed piece, hold shift and press the deconstruct button to select that piece.  Q and E cycle snap points.  Selections per tab persist, so you can change tabs and then hit Esc to quickly swap build pieces on different tabs.
Savheim IV - You've learned to dive under the water by pointing down and pressing crouch!  Go swimming!  Wat-er you waiting for??
Savheim IV - Boss powers now have both passive and active aspects, and you get to choose two!  Read about them at the starting stones or in your Valheim Compendium (inventory -> raven icon).  Keybinds are hardcoded to F and G, regardless of in-game settings.
Savheim IV - World progression is now tied to your character.  You must be present for boss kills to get credit for them.  This affects boss powers, merchant inventory, raids, and maybe more!
Savheim IV - Death went to therapy and is nicer now.  You'll no longer drop equipment, ammo, or consumables when you die, and most non-combat skills don't lose experience.  Resurrect each other with Surtling Cores.
Savheim IV - Check your Valheim Compendium (inventory -> raven icon) for useful game and mod information, including Active Effects.
Savheim IV - Comfort and Rested are easier to obtain, but teleporting long distances will now reduce your Rested duration (Full map radius = ~60m).  F6 toggles a list of pieces while in shelter.  Rest in groups for extra duration!
Savheim IV - Waypoints offer safety from monsters, warmth, and a way to pick up a Rested buff in the field if you sit next to it for long enough when the weather is good.
Savheim IV - Zone progression:  Meadows -> Black Forest -> Swamp -> Mountains -> Plains -> Mistlands -> Ashlands -> Deep North.  Mistlands has better mist.  Ashlands is all new.  Deep North has deadly surprises.
Savheim IV - Outdoor camps, resources, and dungeons will all respawn slowly at varying rates.
Savheim IV - Steps have been taken to ensure we can all coexist in the same world despite playing at different speeds.  Relax and enjoy the journey.
Savheim IV - Sell precious stones & trophies to the traders.  Split stacks in your inventory to control quantities you want to sell.  Double-click items you want to buy to specify quantities.
Savheim IV - The world gets more dangerous the further from the center you travel.  Those who venture far return wealthy... if they return at all.
Savheim IV - Thank you to Iron Gate Studio for making Valheim such an amazing game, to all the creative modders out there for so many massive additions to it, and to the community for beautiful fanart.
Savheim IV - Thank you to some very talented modders:  Azumatt, blaxxun, wackymole, KG, Blacks7ar, ASharpPen, Searica, MSchmoecker, shudnal, and more!
