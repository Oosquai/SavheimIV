<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Sav put a lot of time and love into <color=#AF7F7F>Savheim</color>.  Help the dream!  <color=yellow>1</color> - DO NOT RUSH OTHERS!  <color=yellow>2</color> - Set real prices in your Marketplace rather than giving stuff away for 1 coin.  <color=yellow>3</color> - Remove everything built with your Hammer before abandoning any point of interest.  <color=yellow>4</color> - Clear old tombstones.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Lots of important information has been added to item tooltips.  Pay close attention to <color=yellow>weapon tooltips</color>, check your <color=yellow>Hammer tooltip</color> for new ways to build, take a close look at <color=yellow>Wards</color>, and much more!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You can reposition some GUI windows by clicking & dragging, or <color=orange>Left-Alt</color> / <color=orange>Left-Ctrl</color> and then click & drag.  Press <color=orange>Esc</color> to get a cursor.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Recommended game settings I:  Disable <color=yellow>Depth of Field</color>, <color=yellow>Chromatic Aberration</color>, and <color=yellow>Motion Blur</color>.  You can also disable <color=yellow>Key Hints</color> and <color=yellow>Raven Hints</color> if you like.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Recommended game settings II:  Please try <color=yellow>Settings/Accessibility/Camera Shake</color> = ON; it's been tuned to add impact without being obnoxious.  Iron Gate swapped Mouse <color=orange>2</color> and <color=orange>3</color> for <color=yellow>Secondary Attack</color> and <color=yellow>Block</color>; swap them back if you prefer.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - The game takes a while to load with so many mods installed.  <color=#AF7F7F>It's worth it.</color>  Please be patient.  Go get a tankard of ale and use the Viking potty.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Group commands: <color=orange>/invite</color> [name]; <color=orange>/leave</color>; <color=orange>/remove</color> [name]; <color=orange>/promote</color> [name].  Group benefits:  shared exp, group gem effects, draggable user interface, group chat (<color=orange>/p</color>), colored names, group ping (<color=orange>LeftAlt</color>), and bonus comfort while resting together.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Press <color=orange>U</color> to open Guild panel.  Guilds have been added to <color=#AF7F7F>Savheim</color> to allow sharing semi-private portals.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - All portals will default to <color=yellow>Private</color> on creation.  Portals are harder to obtain though, and you will never be able to teleport metals.  <color=orange>P</color> toggles portal display on the map.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - All weapon classes have been majorly reworked in Savheim IV (again!) to give them unique and improved playstyles.  Give them all another swing, even if you decided against them last playthrough...  Wait, are you reading online info about Valheim meta builds??  This. Is. <color=#AF7F7F>SAVHEIM</color>!!!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - <color=yellow>Block Armor</color> = amount you can block.  [Block Armor * Parry Bonus] = amount you can parry.  Excess damage drains health.  Block Force does nothing.  Magical barriers grant infinite parry stats while active.  Some creatures don't stagger when parried.  This doesn't mean they're immune to other mechanics though, like <color=yellow>Shield Counter</color>, <color=red>Bleed</color>, and more.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - <color=yellow>Backstab</color>: sneaking, attack from behind, and enemy not in combat.  <color=yellow>Critical</color>: attack a staggered enemy.  <color=yellow>Parry</color>: perfectly-timed block.  <color=yellow>Shield Counter</color>: normal block (not parry) with any shield followed immediately by normal attack from any one-handed weapon.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Sloped combat is greatly improved, but you have to aim your crosshairs vertically as well as horizontally!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Harpoons have gained a basic secondary attack.  Primary attacks tether, then the <color=orange>Use</color> key reels in the target if it's lighter than you.  If it's heavier than you, well, with great power comes great responsibility...  seriously, try harpooning a distant tree and then pressing <color=orange>E</color>.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Stamina drain while sneaking can be paused by wearing <color=yellow>leather armor</color>.  Sneaking levels faster and gains movement speed instead of stamina benefits from leveling.  Backstabs reward bonus Sneak experience.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Torches are very useful!  They protect from <color=yellow>Cold</color> and <color=yellow>Freezing</color> in a small radius, last longer, can be repaired and upgraded at a <color=yellow>workbench</color>, and can be enchanted (but not socketed).  Lanterns won't break and provide light even when sheathed.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Most gear can support a maximum of three sockets, though you'll need to hunt rare materials for the third socket.  Jewelry cannot be socketed.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Try to unlock as many recipes as you can...  Bronze Nails?  What do I need those for?  Craft them and see!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Once you can craft them, it's a good idea to keep a <color=yellow>Rune Focus</color> and a <color=yellow>Soulcatcher Lantern</color> with you on adventures.  Use the Rune Focus on lore stones.  Use the lantern on souls of defeated enemies.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You can modify the color of text on signs and portals.  Open the sign prompt as usual and type < color=red> <color=red>or</color> < color=#FF0000> (remove the space between "< color"), then type your message.  Use multiple tags for <color=red>r</color><color=orange>a</color><color=yellow>i</color><color=green>n</color><color=blue>b</color><color=#4B0082>o</color><color=#8A2BE2>w</color> text!  The color automatically resets if you enter new text.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You've learned to dive under the water by pointing down and pressing crouch!  Swimming consumes less stamina as you level it up.  Go swimming!  Who knows what you'll discover down there!  Wat-er you waiting for??
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Boss powers have both passive and active aspects, and you get to choose two!  Read about them at the starting stones or in your <color=yellow>Valheim Compendium</color> (Inventory -> Raven icon).  Keybinds are hardcoded to <color=orange>T</color> and <color=orange>G</color>, regardless of in-game settings.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - World progression is tied to your character.  You must be present for boss kills to get credit for them.  This affects your ability to equip gear & boss powers, trader inventory, world spawns, and maybe more!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You must defeat all main bosses preceeding the tier of gear you wish to equip, including unique weapons.  Iron Sword?  Gotta deal with Eikthyr and The Elder before you know how to use one.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You'll keep your gear when you die, but all skills will lose experience.  Resurrect each other with Coins.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Check your <color=yellow>Valheim Compendium</color> (Inventory -> Raven icon) for useful game and mod information, such as Active Effects, chapters of Jayk's story you've uncovered, gem effects, and more.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - <color=orange>F6</color> toggles a list of comforting pieces while in shelter.  Rest in groups for extra duration!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - <color=yellow>Waypoints</color> offer safety from monsters, warmth, and a way to pick up a <color=yellow>Rested</color> buff in the field if you sit near it during favorable weather.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Zone progression:  Meadows -> Black Forest -> Swamp -> Mountains -> Plains -> Mistlands -> Ashlands -> Deep North.  The Deep North may be visited early, but woe be to those who bring violence to the peaceful forest.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Steps have been taken to ensure we can all coexist in the same world despite playing at different speeds.  Relax and enjoy the journey.  Please do not pressure others to keep up with you.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Sell precious stones, trophies, extra keys, wishbones, and some other boss loot to the traders.  Split stacks in your inventory to control quantities you want to sell.  Double-click items you want to buy to specify quantities.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - The world gets more dangerous the further from the center you travel.  Those who venture far return wealthy... if they return at all.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Thank you to Iron Gate Studio for making Valheim such an amazing game, and then for providing such deep hooks for the modding community!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Thank you to some very talented modders, scripters, and builders:  Azumatt, blaxxun, wackymole, Jere, Raaka, DhakhaR, JPValheim, ashenius, KG, OrianaVenture, Blacks7ar, ASharpPen, Rusty, Searica, MSchmoecker, shudnal, Alcan, Fustercluck, Shigzula, and more!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Thank you to Fox, Woody, goatman, Kry, and Rusty for playtesting Savheim IV and helping resolve lots of issues before launch!  Thanks to goatman for inspiring even better combat mechanics.  Thanks to Kry for fantastic custom banners and sails, and for updated TotinoTunes!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - There's a search feature in the hammer build menu.  Advanced search options:  <color=orange>@<modname></color>, <color=orange>!<characteristic or resource></color>.  When searching the <color=yellow>Catalog</color>, use the search field at the bottom of the window instead of the top.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Gems and jewelry have been completely reworked.  Combined gems are intentionally inaccessible.  Craft a Runaeldr Satchel to conveniently take jewelry options with you on adventures.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Iron Gate gave Ashlands enemies juke attack animations.  They're scary.  Bring a tower shield and block them until you learn their timing.  Go well-prepared in general.  Ashlands is no joke.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Each boss has a set of unique weapons they can drop.  These weapons trade an upgrade for unique mechanics.  You'll have opportunities to find endgame versions of each.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Most bows and crossbows have a small chance their projectiles will leave behind reusable fletchings.  Wood arrows and bolts can be crafted from inventory, but they do less damage.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - All staves and wands that use essence spells have a chance to create essence with each spell impact.  The type of essence will depend on the staff or wand.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - All players can create a marketplace for other players to buy from.  Please help make the economy interesting by setting what you think are competitive prices.  Please don't spoil the game for others by setting minimum prices.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Pick an ammo type to be your top of the order, put it on your hotbar, then tap that number instead of <color=orange>F</color> to reset your rotation.  Ammo sequence is based on inventory location.  The Runaeldr Satchel hides ammo.  Utility spells only enter the rotation if on your main hotbar.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - <color=orange>L-Alt</color>: dodge (see title screen to change; <color=orange>double-click</color> for normal roll).  <color=orange>T</color>, <color=orange>G</color>: boss powers.  <color=orange>F</color>: cycle ammo.  <color=orange>Left-Shift</color>: Zoom bow.  <color=orange>~</color>: swap hotbars.  <color=orange>Z</color>, <color=orange>X</color>, <color=orange>C</color>: mini-hotbar.  <color=orange>P</color>: toggle map portal display.  <color=orange>U</color>: Guilds interface.  <color=orange>Left-ctrl</color>: Change + to - for crafting resource tracker.  <color=orange>F6</color>: Toggle comfort list.  <color=orange>PageUp</color>/<color=orange>PageDown</color>: Scroll chat window.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Items needed to summon bosses have small chances to drop from elite creatures.  These same creatures will begin to hoarde these items after you've slain their master.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Fishing no longer requires stamina.  For performance, fish only appear if you're holding a fishing rod.  Some creatures have been given a chance to drop parts of raw fish that can be used for cooking. 
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You're not intended to achieve high <color=yellow>enchanting</color> levels on early-game gear.  Your Enchanting skill will increase with time as you fight creatures.  Though not listed in the enchanting interface, weapons and shields gain <color=yellow>durability</color> with enchanting.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Most weapon classes offer some form of debuff or secondary damage.  Different creatures are susceptible to these in unique ways.  Experiment to find viable strategies for applying these new tools.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - The more stars a creature has, the better the loot.  At three stars and up you'll start to see increasingly precious components.  <color=yellow>Infused</color> creatures are rare and have coveted reagents.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Meadows will always remain relatively peaceful, regardless of your progress through the game.  The same cannot be said for anywhere else in the world.  Bring a <color=yellow>Torch</color> for the Winter.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Some creatures have learned to dual wield for increased offense, use shields for improved defense, carry light sources to help scout for players and scream to alert allies, or use magic for ... magic.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Haldor, Hildir, and the Bog Witch sell valuable items.  Their inventories will grow as you slay bosses, so check back from time to time...  Hey, hey, do you wanna buy a funnel cake?
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - All weapon skills gain double experience until they've caught up to your highest weapon skill.  Try a new weapon!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - <color=red>Bleed</color> effects do greater damage per tick based on the victim's maximum health.  Bleeds can be stacked for increased damage per tick, and each stack will slightly extend the duration of the bleed by varying amounts, depending on your weapon.  Some creatures don't bleed.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Resistance debuffs are ineffective against creatures that are naturally resistant to the damage type in question.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Immediately after absorbing an attack (not a parry) with any shield, you can perform a high-damage <color=yellow>Shield Counter</color> with any one-handed weapon.  The higher your block ability, the better you'll stay in range.  Staves of Protection have a <color=yellow>Spirit Counter</color> secondary move that can repel any attack.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Hold <color=orange>E</color> while opening a chest to automatically deposit items from your inventory into matching item stacks already present in the chest.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - This season of Savheim introduces a wide variety of combat mechanics.  Some are complex; some are simple.  You don't have to master them all to be successful.  Choose what works for you.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Player commands:  Say <color=orange>!help</color> in the in-game chat window.  Say <color=orange>!unstuck</color> if you've gotten yourself stuck in the environment.  Say <color=orange>!roll</color> to roll a random number between 1 and 100. ... and more!  Most importantly, <color=#red>say !help</color>.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - You can change your <color=yellow>dodge</color> keybind.  Find the <color=orange>DodgeShortcut</color> field here:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\config\Searica.Valheim.DodgeShortcut.cfg.  This information is available on the title screen above the patch notes as well.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Some status effects are dangerous when combined.  Help each other with the Cleanse spell.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - After the initial loading screen when logging onto your character, press <color=orange>Spacebar</color> to scroll through these loading screen tips.
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - Most of the world will slowly reset unless something from the <color=yellow>player base</color> list (Google Valheim wiki) is nearby.  Savheim has excluded basic <color=yellow>Campfires</color> and <color=yellow>Workbenches</color> from this list.  If you need an area away from your base to not reset, the basic wood <color=yellow>Chest</color> and <color=yellow>Standing Wood Torch</color> are your cheapest locks.  Please remove them if you don't plan to come back.  <color=yellow>Player tombstones</color> will also block resets, so please clear them!
<color=#AF7F7F>Savheim IV</color> - The base game networking code seems to fall behind when more than 4 players are nearby.  Please try to adventure in groups of 4 or less.
