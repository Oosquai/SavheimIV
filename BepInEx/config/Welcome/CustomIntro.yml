Jayk the Builder has journeyed through these lands.
He came.  He saw.  He built.  He fished.  He left relics behind.
But one man's relics are another man's... inventory problem.

The creatures of these realms have grown curious.
Some have discovered and begun to wield the relics left behind.
Others have begun to wander in search of more artifacts.
The strongest have started to hoard the most valuable relics.
Some are peaceful.  Some are hungry.  All are restless.

Venture forth and retrace the steps of Jayk.
Honor and preserve his creations.
Reclaim his relics, and read their tooltips.

Go forth, young Viking, for Odin is watching.
What mysteries will you leave for others to find?

Glory and peril await in equal measure as you try to survive...

... in Savheim IV!
