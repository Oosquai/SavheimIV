Jayk woke into nightmare.  Lancing pain in both shoulders, frigid winds buffeting him from all sides, darkness broken only by flashes of lightning.  Something was carrying him through the storm, its grip tight and unyielding.

<i>How high</i> - “AHHHHH!” Jayk screamed as the grip vanished.  He plummeted, heart racing, arms flailing... and then, impossibly, he landed on solid ground.

Dazed, his breath catching in his throat, Jayk staggered upright.  Strange stones, etched with swirling runes, encircled him.  Around them, skeletal trees clawed at the crisp air.  <i>Where in all the gods' cursed creations am I?</i>

Cold, hungry, and utterly lost, Jayk stumbled forward, each step heavy with confusion.  Then he froze.  He wasn't alone.  Perched atop one of the stones was a raven - massive, black as night.  Its bright eyes glinted, hinting at secrets.

“Welcome to Savheim,” it croaked.
