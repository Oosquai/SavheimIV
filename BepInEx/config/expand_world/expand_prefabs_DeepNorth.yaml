# Savheim Deep North - prefabs
########################################################################
# Killing a deer in Deep North starts the Roguelite minigame.
# Mobs get spawned in Waves at regular intervals.
# Killing mobs has a percent chance to increment Subtier.
# Subtier = 7 increases Tier if conditions are satisfied (enough bosses killed).
# Mobs get harder per tier.  Mini-bosses and bosses spawn at specific tiers.
# Get to Tier 8 and clear all mobs to win!  Get loot from mini-bosses and bosses along the way.
# Die or leave to clear status.  Mobs despawn if no flagged players nearby.
# Normal loot tables removed.
# Multiplayer spawns more trash, but with limits.  You can intentionally overpower this event by bringing enough players.
# If using CLLC, more players will also cause mobs to have more health and do more damage.
# Loot quantities are fixed though, so bringing more players means sharing!
#
# TIER | SPAWNS (* indicates must kill boss before passing.  i.e. must kill Elder/Bonemass before you can advance to tier 3.)
#    0 | chance of eikthyr
#    1 | elder or bonemass
#  * 2 | chance of brenna (if too slow killing previous boss!)
#    3 | dragon or yag
#  * 4 | chance of Geirrhafa (if too slow killing previous boss!)
#  * 5 | queen or fader
#    6 | elder, bonemass, or dragon
#    7 | yagluth, queen, or fader (tiers 6 & 7 = two bosses at once!)
#    8 | Victory once all mobs cleared
#    9 | max tier, spawns stop, victory condition still valid

# Main cleanup loops are pokes back and forth between deer_ragdoll and players.
# Players and deer_ragdoll are all attempting to count up from 0.
# They each poke eachother to reset the counts though.
# If either doesn't find the other nearby, the count is allowed to get higher.
# If count exceeds 1, deer ragdoll despawns itself and all nearby roguelite mobs, and players clear their state.
# Loops every 3 secs, increment at 0s, reset at 1s.  All prefabs count and poke for resets independently.
# Filter DeepNorth for deer, but not for player, since we want player to still remove state if they teleport away.

# NOTES
# Need to add roaming guardians, inquisitors, and deer!  Hearing range 100 for patrols.
#   God weapon:  secondary casts shield, value scales with Swords.  if shielded, secondary is skybreaker + blackhole + FX.  if FX, primary applies VeryWeak Slash + Slow.  Uses eitr + stam.  fast attack 1h or 2h sword versions.  CWS_Sword_1 / CWS_TH_Sword_5 (recolor green or blue?)?
#   Odin's gifts throughout previous zones are temporal/ethereal versions of them.
#   Purity, Serenity, Tranquility?  synonyms...
#   Bind on Equip??
# Make ancient loot, including buff weapons, odin weapons.
# Finish loot tables for mini-bosses.
# Test unique battleaxe that siphons souls

# Multiplayer Testing
# 1) Difficulty (should have trash per player, but same number of bosses)
# 2) Resurrect does not clear roguelite state, nor trigger end broadcast?
# 3) Loot for only one player?
# 4) players entering late should get tagged with roguelite, to prevent cheesing
# 5) At startup, only broadcast goes to all.  RPC_Message goes only to local player.
