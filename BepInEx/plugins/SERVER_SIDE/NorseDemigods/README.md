## Overview

Play as a demigod, chosen from a daughter or son of Odin, blessed with the powers of the gods. This mod adds unique classes with magic, spells, abilities, items and more.

Please note that **your advanced settings will be reset on every new update** for re-balancing purposes, unless 'Automatically Update Configs' is disabled in your configs.

## Setup

It is important that you do not rename the file "NorseDemigods.dll" and ensure that other files that come along with the mod are located in the same folder, else the mod will not function correctly (if at all).

Mods which seem to be incompatible or partially incompatible with NorseDemigods:

| Mod | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| CombatincentivesREwrite | Reported by an user on Discord: Cannot save nor respawn when using both mods in parallel. |
| Shawesomes Divine Armaments | Reported by an user on Discord: Having 'ssj' activated will make your skill leveling too fast. |
| Veinmine | Not all spells that damage ore veins will function correctly, but no hard incompatibility per se. |

## Getting Started

* Check your in-game **'compendium'** (click on the bird icon on the 'tab' menu) for all necessary instructions on how to get started. Your 'compendium' will be updated with more information after having chosen a demigod, such as abilities, attributes, infused materials, and even the possible **hotkey combinations for your abilities**.
* You might want to change the hotkeys for your abilities by tweaking the values in section '(Hotkeys)' in your configs. The user interface is also customizable in section 'User Interface', which can be updated in real time if using a configuration manager mod.

## General Tips

* Although the mod is linearly balanced and somewhat vanilla friendly, once you get used to it, you could feel overpowered. **It is recommended that you change the value of 'Difficulty' in the mod configs** to something else, such as 'Challenging' (recommended difficulty), or use the world modifiers or another mod to increase the game difficulty.
* Even though this mod will fully work with already existing characters, it is recommended that you use this mod on a fresh character. Some demigods fully rely on their main skill (demigod) to cause damage (e.g. Fenrir), which will naturally and steadily progress from the start of the game, but may be tedious to catch up with if started late.
* **You can enable and disable optional features in your configs**, such as 'Teleportation' or 'Harpoon Fishing', which was inspired by the 'SpearFish' mod by Korppis, allowing you to catch fish with an Abyssal harpoon and upgrade it. This mod introduces sweet fish recipes, which are an almost essential type of food for demigods.
* Due to demigods having limited types of preferred weapons, I highly recommend the 'Warfare' mod by Therzie, which will not only introduce new weapons, but also new combat animations (for valkyries this is quite a big change with the introduction of pikes).

## Hotkeys

Below are the default hotkeys for the commands that this mod introduces.
* Please note that some abilities are triggered by a combination of keys, which can all be **found in your 'compendium'** after choosing a demigod.
* Some abilities are triggered using the special attack in conjuction with another event, such as blocking or jumping. You can find all combinations in your 'compendium' after choosing a demigod.
* **All hotkeys can be changed in the config file** in section '(Hotkeys)'. It is recommended, however, that you use a configuration manager mod (such as the 'Official BepInEx Configuration Manager' mod by Azumatt) to bind the hotkeys directly in-game.

| Command | Default Hotkey | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ability A | Front-side mouse button | You should definitely change this hotkey if you do not have side mouse buttons. |
| Ability B | Back-side mouse button | You should definitely change this hotkey if you do not have side mouse buttons. |
| Ability C | Blocking + Front-side mouse button | You can assign a dedicated hotkey to this ability if you do not want to hold block. |
| Ability D | Blocking + Back-side mouse button | You can assign a dedicated hotkey to this ability if you do not want to hold block. |
| Ignore Special Attack | Left Alt (Hold) | Some abilities override the weapon special attacks. Hold that key to ignore an special attack introduced by an ability. |
| Teleport | P | If you wish to disable the teleport ability, you can simply disable it in section 'Teleportation' in your configs (instead of unbinding the hotkey). |

## Demigods

| Demigod | Brief Description | Favorite Element(s) | Favorite Weapon(s) | Favorite Armor(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eir | Heals, conjures an elemental shield and even organic matter, bringing light to even the depths of the underworld. | Spirit & fire | Spears, swords & shields | Heavy |
| Fenrir | Lands destructive punches with the companion of a wolf, so strong that they will take down even trees. | Frost | Fists | Light |
| Freyja | A member of the family of Valkyries. Charms enemies and calls the nature for help. | Poison | Spears, swords & shields | Heavy |
| Hel | The gate keeper of the underworld. Brings darkness to the surroundings while followed by many minions. | Spirit & poison | Two-handed axes, two-handed swords, polearms & knives | Heavy & light |
| Njord | Calls the force of the seas to summon tornados and even necks to help with gathering resources. Swims and sails faster. | Frost & lightning | Axes, swords & polearms | Heavy |
| Surtr | Burns everything around by using weapons, spells, and even minions. | Fire | Axes, swords & polearms | Heavy |
| Thor | Dashes at the speed of light and strikes enemies with lightning. | Lightning | Hammers, axes & Himminafl | Heavy |
| Ullr | A true hunter accompanied by a wolf. Master of bows, knives and stealth. | Frost & poison | Bows, knives, spears & axes | Light |

## Infused Materials

This mod introduces several infused materials that you can craft and consume to become even more powerful. For 'Infused Abilities' (which will make your abilities more powerful), you can refer to your compendium (introduction) to find clues about the recipe for your demigod (after choosing one).

<summary>How to translate the mod?</summary>

**In order to translate the content into another language:**
* If you **do not** have a folder named 'Translations' where 'NorseDemigods.dll' is located: Copy 'EN-NorseDemigods.json' and rename the "EN" letters into the language code you want to translate the mod into (as per the below table). E.g. 'EN-NorseDemigods.json' into 'KO-NorseDemigods.json' for Korean.
* If you **do** have a folder named 'Translations' where 'NorseDemigods.dll' is located: Open the 'Translations' folder, copy the 'English' folder and rename the copied folder into another language as per the table below (e.g. 'Swedish').

### v1.1.2
* Saiyan demigod completed. This is an over-powered demigod just for testing mechanisms by the mod author and for fun, which can only be activated via the console command 'MakeMeSaiyan'.
* Bug which was causing Fenrir to gain massive amounts of experience while blocking fixed; to compensate, experience gained by Fenrir increased by roughly 50%.
* Eir can now destroy higher tier structures and resources with ability 'Holy Sun' after infusion.
* Other small tweaks.

### v1.1.1
* Chinese translation added into the game. Thank you, Khadgar!

* Prevent demigod's skill loss on death (can be disabled in the configs).
* Added a chance that Eir's damage spread will turn into an explosion, increasing the area of effect radius.

### v1.1.0
* Compatibility with the Ashlands update!
* Russian translation added into the game. Thank you, Эри!
* Changed the threshold of heavy armors to 3% movement speed penalty, meaning that any armor piece with a movement speed penalty equal or lesser than 2% will be considered as light.

### v1.0.6
* Built-in difficulty revamped for better balancing. Higher difficulties will also slightly affect the base damage of enemies. Also added the possibility to increase the spawn count of weaker creatures such as greydwarves or skeletons under the 'Difficulty' section.
* Fixed an issue with Therzie's mods which were setting the damage modifier to 0 for many of my abilities that are not bound to a particular skill. This is a work-around until Therzie hopefully decides to fix this on his end since it could affect other mods too.
* Fixed a few lines that were broken with the Portuguese Brazilian translation. It should work correctly now.

### v1.0.5
* Portuguese Brazilian translation added into the game. Thank you, WayWard!
* Added a cheat console command to play as a test character, 'Saiyan', used by the mod creator to test new abilities and attributes.
* Tool tier for ability 'Holy Sun' is now configurable, meaning it can be configured to damage high tier modded trees and ores.
* Fixed a bug which was taking the stamina value to a negative number when blocking as Fenrir at level 0.

### v1.0.4
* Drop multiplier from attribute 'Hunter' will also affect feathers dropped from birds.
* Ullr's sneaking visual effect will now also fully affect equipped armor.

### v1.0.3

* Iceshards will no longer be launched when having a weapon equipped.
* Infused arrows will now spread frost damage to very close enemies.
* Infused arrows will cause more damage.
* Small tweaks and bug fixing.

* Added compatibility with mod 'Harpoon Melee Attack And Upgrading' by Goldenrevolver.
* Fixed an issue with ability 'Infused Arrows' which was not working with crossbows.
* Two new translation keys added:
```
ability_teleport_location_expiration_se
ability_teleport_location_expiration_warning
```

### v1.0.1
* Fix for ability 'Elemental Shield', which was breaking the game when trying to absorb periodic damage.
* Fenrir's command for the slash ability inverted with ice shards (slash is now triggered with a simple special attack while unarmed, whereas ice shards are triggered with blocking + special attack).
* Fenrir can now chop down trees with fist weapons. However, fist weapons will not benefit from the block armor bonus from Titan Arms and will suffer an attack speed penalty when casting iceshards.
* Fenrir is now allowed to use torches.
* Translation files combined into one: 'EN-NorseDemigods.json' for English. Renamed translation keys:
```
enhanced_armor_fenring_additional_tooltip --> item_set_fenring_enhanced_armor_additional_tooltip

unarmed_tool_tier_level_up_message --> attribute_titanarms_unarmed_tool_tier_level_up_message
```

### v1.0.0

* Added a setting in the configs to disable the automatic update of your advanced settings whenever the mod is updated.
* Added a hotkey which you can hold to ignore any special attacks introduced by the mod, e.g. 'Slash'.
* Surtr has now greatly improved abilities after infusion, with new mechanics and special effects.
* Fenrir can now punch logs that are too low. In fact, all players can now more easily hit things which are too high or low.
* Fenrir can now normally use fist weapons (e.g. claws), but at a reduced damage and stamina usage (since Fenrir can punch much faster by default).
* New ability for all demigods added: 'Teleport' - It will teleport you back to your bed, and then to the previous saved location before teleporting to bed. Can be disabled in the configs.
* New attribute for 'Hel' added: 'Soul Reaper' - It has a chance to make monsters explode upon dying.
* Added a setting to customize the recipe for crafting the Runestone (used to choose a demigod).

* Vast re-balancing of abilities and attributes, with the most noticeable one being adjustment of the movement speed across several demigods.
* Added a new demigod: 'Eir'. Eir is another Valkyrie, but with stronger healing powers and holy abilities overall.
