#Increases the minimum velocity required for ships and carts to take impact damage, generally just above the maximum speed achievable by the rudder. Also significantly stabilises carts on boats, allowing you to walk them on larger boats and sail around without constant damage ticks.
#
#Velocities:
#2 m/s - Raft
#3 m/s - Karve
#4 m/s - Cart, Longship, Drakkar
#
#As a side effect, boats can generally beach themselves at rudder speeds without taking damage. No changes are made to damage from enemies, ship base health, or movement speeds.
### Minimum velocity breakpoints for ships and carts taking impact damage

# Raft
- name: minVelocity2
  floats:
  - ImpactEffect.m_minVelocity, 2
# Karve
- name: minVelocity3
  floats:
  - ImpactEffect.m_minVelocity, 3
# Cart, Longship, Drakkar
- name: minVelocity4
  floats:
  - ImpactEffect.m_minVelocity, 4


### Higher minimum velocity for ships and carts taking impact damage, ships won't generally take damage when moving with just the rudder, and you can walk carts along the larger boats

# JPValheim
Heres some of the stuff I used for the quest reward ships. There are 4 quest reward ships in Pom. They all grant players rested bonuses when they do stuff near the ship.
Fishing raft (invincible, constant moder)
Tune (Very fast very high health karve)
Knarr (Longship with 350 slots of storage)
Barden (Invincible Drakkar)

Theres also a self defense that spawns mistiles when players arent nearby and the boat takes damage
