Area pipette performance:
Disable health and support

buildings made with -1 health so no damage is calculated = less performance impact, less network traffic
also means no iron beams are required, no skull1s or icefloors = less objects
usage of build pieces that save on performance, blackmarble_floor_large etc.
using scale-adjusted rocks as floors/cielings/walls to save on instances
removing unneccasry data from build pieces, eg. using creator=0
avoiding overuse of performance demanding objects, piece_oven etc.
trees and rocks near to busy locations made unbreakable = prevents _fracs from appearing which are more demanding on performance
thinning out of environments near busy areas, reducing forest density etc.
removed zone spawners near busy locations = no creature spawns, creatures are demanding on performance
removing unneeded locations near busy areas
using alternate light sources such as CastleKit_groundtorch that use less performance than player built lights
any player style light sources given Fireplace,infiniteFuel,true  = no ticking fuel timers
Pickables removed from busy areas = less objects to load, no ticking timers for respawns
Terrain paint manipulated to prevent grass clutter loading in busy areas = less objects to load
